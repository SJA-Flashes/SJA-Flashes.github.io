      <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Located in St. Augustine, Florida, The Flashes! We are team 5753 of
        the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition as team 5753. Our rookie year was
        in 2015 at the Orlando Regional. Although we are a small team, we can
        still come together to build amazing robots. We finished our rookie year
        off by winning the Rookie Inspiration Award. We are committed to letting
        every student express their robot building skills in a fun environment.</p>

        <h1>2018 Robot</h1>
          <p>Our robot this year focused on the switch, portals, and vault.
            Pneumatics were used to pinch power cubes in the front and to push
            power cubes into the switches out from the top. One member of the
            drive team would go to a portal so the robot could be fed power
            cubes on the top, and release them into the switches. If the
            opportunity came, we could climb onto another robot and be lifted
            up to get an extra ranking point. We successfully did a triple climb
            with the help of team 4592.</p>
