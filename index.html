                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Located in St. Augustine, Florida, The Flashes! We are team 5753 of
                    the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition. Our rookie year was
                    in 2015 at the Orlando Regional. Although we are a small team, we can
                    still come together to build amazing robots. We finished our rookie year
                    off by winning the Rookie Inspiration Award. We are committed to letting
                    every student express their robot building skills in a fun environment.

                <h1>2018 Robot</h1>
                <p>Our robot this year focused on the switch, portals, and vault.
                    Pneumatics were used to pinch power cubes in the front and to push
                    power cubes into the switches out from the top. One member of the
                    drive team would go to a portal so the robot could be fed power
                    cubes on the top, and release them into the switches. We could also
                    put power cubes in the vault to get power ups. If the opportunity
                    came, we could climb onto another robot and be lifted up to get an
                    extra ranking point. We successfully did a triple climb with the help
                    of team 4592. View our other robots <a href="robots.html">here</a>.
