        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Located in St. Augustine, Florida, The Flashes! We are team 5753 of
          the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition. Our rookie year was in 2015 at
          the Orlando Regional. Although we are a small team, we can still come
          together to build amazing robots. We finished our rookie year off by
          winning the Rookie Inspiration Award. We are committed to letting
          every student express their robot building skills in a fun environment.

        <p>Our robot this year focused on the switch, portals, and vault.
          Pneumatics were used to pinch power cubes in the front and to push
          power cubes into the switches out from the top. One member of the
          drive team would go to a portal so the robot could be fed power cubes
          on the top, and release them into the switches. We could also put
          power cubes in the vault to get power ups. If the opportunity came,
          we could climb onto another robot and be lifted up to get an extra
          ranking point. We successfully did a triple climb with the help of
          team 4592. View our other robots
