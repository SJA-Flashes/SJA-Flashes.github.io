                <p>In our fourth and best season ever, our 2018 robot focused on the switch and portals. We
                   made large strides in incorporating more technology, such as cameras. Pneumatics were used
                   to pinch power cubes in the front and to push power cubes into the switches out from the
                   top. One member of the drive team would go to a portal so the robot could be fed power
                   cubes and release them into the switches. If the opportunity came, we would climb onto another
                   robot and be lifted up to get an extra ranking point. We successfully did a triple climb with
                   the help of team 4592. We placed 25 out of 60 teams, and made it to the quarterfinals for the
                   first time in our team's 4 year history,in the Orlando Regional Competition.

                <p>In our third season, our robot for the 2017 competition, First Steamworks, focused
                   on two aspects of the game, the fuel and the gears. We used a pneumatics- powered sheet-
                   metal door to release the fuel balls into the boiler. We also had a holding device to hold the
                   gear in place after it dropped into place, then we would deliver it to the airship.
                   We placed 54 out of 64 teams in the Orlando Regional Competition.

                <p>In our second season, our robot for the 2016 competition, First Stronghold,
                   was based all on playing defense. It was also able to cross many defenses, like the
                   low bar, the moat, the rough terrain, and the rock wall by itself. But,
                   we were able to cross the sally port, the drawbridge, and the
                   portcullis with the help of our alliance mates. We were very effective on
                   defense, as we were able to block robots from scoring and creating penalties
                   against them. We were also able to smash other robots with our robot. We
                   finished 13 out of 60 teams in the West Palm Regional Competition.

                <img class="robot2015-img" src="imgs/2015robot.jpg">
                <p>This was our rookie season. Our robot for the 2015 competition, Recycle Rush, focused
                   on lifting the crates and stacking them on top of each other. It was also able to stack
                   multiple crates, plus the trash can, on top of each other. The human player would then
                   throw the noodle in for the bonus points. The lifting mechanism was a forklift with an
                   extension to get underneath the side of the crates to lift it.
