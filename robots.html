        <p>In our fourth season, our 2018 robot focused on the
          switch and portals. We made large strides in incorporating more
          technology, such as cameras. Pneumatics were used to pinch power
          cubes in the front and to push power cubes into the switches out
          from the top. One member of the drive team would go to a portal so
          the robot could be fed power cubes and release them into the
          switches. If the opportunity came, we would climb onto another
          robot and be lifted up to get an extra ranking point. We
          successfully did a triple climb with the help of team 4592. We
          placed 25 out of 60 teams, and made it to the quarterfinals for
          the first time in our team's 4 year history, in the Orlando
          Regional Competition.</p>

        <p>In our third season, our robot for the 2017 competition, First
          Steamworks, focused on two aspects of the game, the fuel and the
          gears. We used a pneumatics- powered sheet- metal door to release
          the fuel balls into the boiler. We also had a holding device to
          hold the gear in place after it dropped into place, then we would
          deliver it to the airship. We placed 54 out of 64 teams in the
          Orlando Regional Competition.</p>

        <p>In our second season, our robot for the 2016 competition, First
          Stronghold, was based all on playing defense. It was also able to
          cross many defenses, like the low bar, the moat, the rough terrain,
          and the rock wall by itself. But, we were able to cross the sally
          port, the drawbridge, and the portcullis with the help of our
          alliance mates. We were very effective on defense, as we were able
          to block robots from scoring and creating penalties against them.
          We were also able to smash other robots with our robot. We
          finished 13 out of 60 teams in the West Palm Regional Competition.</p>

        <p>This was our rookie season. Our robot for the 2015 competition,
          Recycle Rush, focused on lifting the crates and stacking them on
          top of each other. It was also able to stack multiple crates, plus
          the trash can, on top of each other. The human player would then
          throw the noodle in for the bonus points. The lifting mechanism
          was a forklift with an extension to get underneath the side of the
          crates to lift it.</p>
